# 🧮 SORTING ALGORITHMS: Insertion Sort Using a Class

This program demonstrates how to implement the **Insertion Sort algorithm** using a Python class. It allows the user to input a list of numbers, sorts them using the insertion sort technique, and displays the sorted list.

---

## 🎯 Aim

To develop a Python class with functions to:
- Create a list of integers
- Sort it using the **Insertion Sort** algorithm
- Display the sorted list

---

## 🧠 Algorithm

1. **Start the program**
2. **Define a class** `InsertionSorter`
3. Inside the class:
   - `create_list()`:
     - Read number of elements
     - Store them in a list
   - `insertion_sort()`:
     - Iterate from the second element to the end
     - Move elements greater than the key to one position ahead
     - Insert the key at the correct position
   - `print_list()`:
     - Print the sorted list
4. **Create an object** of the class
5. **Call** the methods in order: `create_list()`, `insertion_sort()`, and `print_list()`
6. **End the program**

arr = list(map(int, input("Enter elements: ").split()))

for i in range(1, len(arr)):
    key = arr[i]
    j = i - 1
    while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:
        arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
        j -= 1
    arr[j + 1] = key

print("Sorted array:", arr)

## OUTPUT:

Enter elements: 5 3 8 1
Sorted array: [1, 3, 5, 8]

## RESULT:
The programs were implemented successfully and the outputs were verified.
